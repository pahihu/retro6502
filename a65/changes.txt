A65 bug fixes and changes

1.04  To improve MOS Technology compatibility, the following restrictions
      have been made: labels may not begin with an underscore or end with
      a colon; white space always acts as a field delimiter.

1.03  Location counter changes would not be reflected in binary output
      file. Comment character ';' could not be placed immediately after
      some operands. Could not specify symbol table greater than 32767
      bytes. Improved label parsing and error reporting. Default symbol
      table size increased to 35000 bytes.

1.02  Error messages and the lines they reference are now directed to
      standard output to allow piping to a file or to the screen using
      MORE. Maximum label length reduced to 16. Minor display fixes.

1.0   First release
